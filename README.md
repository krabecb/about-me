# 🧑🏽‍💻 Brian Krabec

**`Senior Instructional Associate & Developer`**

I teach lectures to my wonderful students by day and create front-end projects by night! Feel free to browse around! You'll find full-stack/back-end applications I've built since I was a student, archived coding challenges that I triumphantly completed, and technologies that peaked my interest. Most of my time is committed to lecture prep/teaching and to the success of my students. I have soft spot for education and the perpetual process of learning!
